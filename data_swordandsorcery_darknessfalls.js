While they have avoided any toruble because of the detour, nobody is actually happy. A problem avoided is rarely a problem solbed. As if to confirm the sentiment, the forest becomes enshrouded in the mountains' dark shadows.",

When the Heroes question one of the refugees, he tells the tale of his doomed city. \"Go no further, the town is cursed! When the dead rise from their graves, there is no place for the living. Run, you fools!\" As the party approaches the town, more and more refugees flood the road, and the atmosphere becomes tense. In silence, the Heroes reach the gates of the town and are welcomed by screams from the nearby central square!",

Entering Moonchild means tempting your own fate!\" The gates open, and Marcus introduces the Heroes, asking to speak to the mayou.

A thick shoroud of dard clouds surrounds the castle, isolating it from the rest of the world.

I will not be any help in the castle rooms, but form here - with the help of the gods - I will try to weaken the enshrouding sorcery. Should I succeed, you will have word from me.

Each avatar bestows items to the hero he communicates with, holy gifts for the imminent battle. Then, the vision fades as the gods nod in benevolent farewell.(See <b>Emporium Special Quest Rules</b>). Marcus witnesses the scene, then kneels down and prays. Then the cleric utters solemn words. \"The gods are with us. Beyound that door you will find your freedom and the salavation of the Talon Coast! We are not alone at the end of this journey!
